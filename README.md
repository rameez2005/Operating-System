# Operating System Project Documentation

## Overview
This is a custom operating system project that implements various system functionalities and user applications. The project is designed to work on both Windows and Linux platforms, featuring a colorful command-line interface and multiple interactive applications.

## System Requirements
- Windows 10 or Linux operating system
- C++ compiler (g++ or compatible)
- Make utility (for building the project)

## Project Structure
The project consists of several key components:

### Core System Files
- `start.cpp`: Main system interface and task manager
- `time.cpp`: System time management
- `messagebox.cpp`: System message handling
- `stopwatch.cpp`: Stopwatch functionality
- `calendar.cpp`: Calendar application

### Applications
1. **Calculator** (`calculator.cpp`)
   - Basic arithmetic operations
   - Memory management
   - Error handling for division by zero

2. **Tic Tac Toe** (`tictactoe.cpp`)
   - Single player vs Computer
   - AI-based moves
   - Score tracking
   - Colorful interface

3. **Banking System** (`banking.cpp`)
   - Account management
   - Transaction handling
   - Balance tracking

4. **File Management**
   - `createfile.cpp`: File creation utility
   - `deletefile.cpp`: File deletion utility

5. **Games**
   - `hangman.cpp`: Hangman word game
   - `guessgame.cpp`: Number guessing game

6. **Utility Programs**
   - `stringlen.cpp`: String length calculator
   - `length.cpp`: Length conversion utility
   - `findprime.cpp`: Prime number finder
   - `factorial.cpp`: Factorial calculator
   - `binarysearch.cpp`: Binary search implementation

## Features

### System Interface
- Colorful command-line interface
- Real-time system time display
- Available RAM monitoring
- Task management system
- Kernel mode access

### Memory Management
- Shared memory implementation
- Process memory tracking
- Memory allocation/deallocation

### User Interface
- ANSI color support for both Windows and Linux
- Clear screen functionality
- Formatted output display
- Interactive menus

## Building and Running

### Compilation
```bash
# For Windows
g++ -o start start.cpp
g++ -o calculator calculator.cpp
g++ -o tictactoe tictactoe.cpp
# ... compile other components

# For Linux
make
```

### Running the System
```bash
# Start the main system
g++ start.cpp -o start -lpthread
./start 2048 8 256
```

## Color Scheme
The system uses the following color codes:
- Red: Error messages
- Green: Success messages and positive outcomes
- Yellow: Prompts and warnings
- Blue: Information display
- Magenta: Computer-related messages
- Cyan: System headers and titles

## Memory Management
- Each application uses shared memory for process tracking
- Memory is allocated and deallocated properly
- System resources are managed efficiently

## Error Handling
- Input validation
- Division by zero protection
- File operation error handling
- Memory allocation checks

## Cross-Platform Compatibility
- Conditional compilation for Windows/Linux
- Platform-specific color codes
- System command compatibility

## Security Features
- Input validation
- Memory protection
- Process isolation
- Resource management

## Future Improvements
1. Add more applications
2. Implement file system
3. Add user authentication
4. Enhance memory management
5. Add networking capabilities
